Data analysis and ML on CSO Ireland tourism expenditure data (2023–2025)
# Ireland Tourism Expenditure Analysis (2023–2025)

## Overview

This project explores tourism expenditure patterns in Ireland using data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for the period January 2023 to February 2025. The focus is on identifying high-expenditure regions and categories (accommodation, fares, etc.) to help support tourism strategy and policy.

## Objectives

- Analyze monthly trends and region-wise tourism expenditure
- Break down expenditure by category (e.g., accommodation, fares)
- Visualize patterns using Python
- Apply machine learning for pattern detection and prediction

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (ML models)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Key Findings

- Certain regions consistently contribute the most to tourism revenue
- Accommodation and fares dominate overall spending
- ML models support trend forecasting for regional policy
